## Using Gmail Scheduler
Quick initial set up
- [Click to open Gmail Scheduler](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw6hnnKGeG6xUsbRE9c3WSvJibTbaW88DP9f83e8lFnc1v1kL0/exec)
- Accept permisssions
- Create labels as required. Feel free to add as many as you like. A pro tip is to use "2 hours later" then for days use "two days later" and so on. This means that 2 will show on the labels above two and so on. This will help make selecting the scheudule easier.

Outgoing messages
- Now you are all set and go back to gmail and compose a message and add the label under timer as required.
- Do not click on the send button. Only set the label and then leave the message in drafts.

Returning messages to inbox
- Another useful feature is to allow gmail to return messages back to inbox.
- Simply apply a label under timer to any of our message and it will be returned back to your inbox as per schedule.
